# Git Conflict Resolution Exercise

Let's carry out a basic exercise:
1. Create a new branch from `main`.
2. Open `script.py` and replace the placeholder `<Your Name Here>` with your name.
3. Commit your change and create a Pull Request.

Next, a different change will be merged into `main` that also modifies `script.py`.  
This will create a merge conflict on your branch.

### Your task

- Update your branch with the latest changes from `main`.
- Resolve the merge conflict.
- Commit and push the resolved changes so the Pull Request no longer shows conflicts.
